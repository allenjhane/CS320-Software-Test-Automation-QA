# CS320 - Software Test Automation & QA
Below is the information for the projects done for this class

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure that my code, program, and software is functional and secure by constantly rerunning the program as I develop the software so I can catch errors sooner rather than later. I also use standard industry best practices in order to create the software in the programs I create. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
In order to interprest user needs and incorporate them into a program I would have to talk to our team's scrum master and/or product owner about the clients needs. After development through sprints, I would communicate to the team their thoughts and talk to the scrum master or product owner if this meets the client's needs.

### How do I approach designing software?
To approach designing software, it is good to create a list of system requirements and software needs based on the product idea. After listing these requirements, an outline of the system and/or UML needs to be created to make it easier for the developer to outline the software for the system. After outlining, the software needs to be tested and constant changes may need to be designed and made throughout development, even after release depending on the product.
